## 500 files in 23 Languages

The GDL print repository offers more than 500 files in 23 languages at the time of launch in March 2020. This includes a number of languages in Africa and Asia, in addition to our bridge language English. The titles are sources from partners that offer different types of books, including government approved books in the GDL category called “Classroom books” and books that we define as “Library books”.

## License and fileformat
All the books in the repository allow for re-use and translation, and more than 90% of the titles allow commercial re-use. The most common licences are CC-BY and CC-BY-SA, but there are also titles with CC-BY-NC-SA. It is essential to check the license on every title before re-using. 

The books are shared as they were delivered from our partners in eighter PDF file format or InDesign file format. In most cases, they would need to be altered to fit technical requirements before local printing.
